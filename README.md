Mobile app to help 1st grade student to learn new words at school

(Mobile app only availble on TestFlight for the moment.)

My mother, a primary school teacher for first-grade students in France, told me about her project to teach her students new words through audio quizzes. I immediately thought of creating an app for her.

This app allows recording a first audio to create a riddle, followed by a second audio recording revealing the answer, which is the word to be taught to the students. Additionally, a photo of the word can be added to help students understand its meaning.

Once several quizzes are published, a quiz session is held in front of the class. Initially, riddles are played for the students, and the teacher waits for the correct answer to the riddle. If the word to be learned isn't guessed by anyone, the teacher can press a button to display the word's photo and the answer to the riddle on the board in front of all the students.

While this app was originally created for a single teacher, it will be available on app stores in the next two weeks, allowing students to learn new words from home as well.

Also, the design of this app has been thought so that children who can't read yet can use the app easily.
